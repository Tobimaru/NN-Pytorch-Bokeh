# NN-Pytorch-Bokeh
This is a collection of python notebooks with examples of Neural Networkds in PyTorch with visualization in Bokeh. Currently it contains:

* One-dimensional GAN example in which the generator tries to mimic a Gaussian distribution. The notebook currently implements different generator and discriminator models and different GAN types for comparison, based on the following sources:
